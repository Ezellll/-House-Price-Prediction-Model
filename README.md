# -House-Price-Prediction-Model

## Business Problem
It is desired to carry out a machine learning project regarding the prices of different types of houses by using the dataset of each house's features and house prices.


## Dataset
This dataset of residential homes in Lowa, Ames contains 79 explanatory variables. You can access the dataset and competition page of the project, which also has a competition on Kaggle, from the link below. Since the dataset belongs to a kaggle competition, there are two different csv files, train and test. House prices are left blank in the test dataset, and we are expected to estimate these values for you.


## Task
Develop a machine learning model that predicts house prices with minimum error from the data set we have.
